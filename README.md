# Financial Data Fraud Prediction (On going project)

## Background
The ease of doing transactions is at hand. Mobile transactions are a field that has a growing market. However, transactions using mobile or online still have the risk of fraud, with no exceptions. So, I want to try to predict fraud and looking for the pattern which is reflected as a fraud activity.<br>

The pipeline used for this example consists of several step steps:
1. Problem Definition
2. Data Collection
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Web Dashboard Visualization
5. Modeling (Data cleaning, split the data, train, testing, tunning)
5. Implementation (optional)

## Problem Definition
Based on the background described above, we will predict fraud in mobile transactions and look at behavior patterns from mobile transaction data.

## Data Collection
Then I found dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/code">mobile money transaction dataset</a> from Kaggle based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313138956_PAYSIM_A_FINANCIAL_MOBILE_MONEY_SIMULATOR_FOR_FRAUD_DETECTION">this paper</a><br>
For data description, you can refer to that link or datadisc.txt on my repo
